# passGen


**A JavaScript Password Generator**

**Goals:** 
Code a random password based on user-selected criteria.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Run in the browser
- [x] Dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code
- [x] Clean and polished user interface
- [x] Responsive, adapts to multiple screen sizes
- [x] Ask the user a series of questions:
  1. Length of password (numeric input) <br/>
   -- then validate length is between 8 and 128
  2. Include numbers (ok/cancel confirm)
  3. Include uppercase characters (ok/cancel confirm)
  4. Include uppercase characters (ok/cancel confirm)
  5. Include special characters (ok/cancel confirm)  <br/>
   -- then validate the user selected at least one character type
- [x] Any invalid response will terminate password generation and the user must start over.
- [x] Responsive layout
- [x] Once user has entered valid responses, generate a password that meets their criteria and display it in the box

**Additional considerations:**

- [x] Provide links to Github repo and Github pages
    * **Github repo:** https://github.com/Kevponce194/passGen
    * **GitHub Pages:** https://kevponce194.github.io/passGen/
- [x] Continue git command line executions
 
### Additional Code added beyond scope of assignment

- [x] Once I stylized my page and added the questions to it, the button scrolled below the visible window on a mobile phone. So the user must scroll down a little hiding the password window area. I added a piece of code to scroll the window back to the to the password window.
